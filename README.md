**Live Demo:** [https://sinahatami.github.io/dv/](https://sinahatami.github.io/dv/)

Welcome to the **dv-project**. This is a specialized web application built with **Angular** and **D3.js** designed to explore global health trends, socio-economic indicators, and life expectancy through interactive visualizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Angular CLI
- D3.js library (v7+)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the home page.

## 📈 Visualizations Overview

This project features five distinct interactive charts, each focusing on a different aspect of global health data.

| Chart Type | Key Metrics | Component |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dual-Axis Composite** | Life Expectancy & YoY Change | `FirstChartComponent` |
| **Bubble Chart** | Immunization & Adult Mortality | `SecondChartComponent` |
| **Heatmap** | Standardized Socio-Economic Indicators | `ThirdChartComponent` |
| **Scatter Linear** | GDP vs. Life Expectancy Correlation | `FourthChartComponent` |
| **Area Chart** | Health Expenditure Trends (2000-2014) | `FifthChartComponent` |

## 🔍 Detailed Component Breakdown

### 1. Dual-Axis Composite Chart

- **Description:** Analyzes the top 50 countries by life expectancy alongside their annual change rate.
- **Features:**
  - **Bar Graph:** Displays the average Life Expectancy Range.
  - **Trend Line:** Overlays Year-Over-Year (YoY) changes.
  - **Interactivity:** Interactive tooltips for specific country metrics.

### 2. Bubble Chart

- **Description:** Explores the relationship between immunization coverage (Polio, Diphtheria, Hepatitis B) and adult mortality.
- **Features:**
  - **Dynamic Scaling:** Bubble sizes are mapped to life expectancy values.
  - **Axes:** X-axis for coverage percentage; Y-axis for mortality rates.

### 3. Heatmap Chart

- **Description:** A comparative view of health and socio-economic indicators for the top 15 countries.
- **Features:**
  - **Indicators:** Includes GDP, Schooling, BMI, HIV/AIDS, and more.
  - **Color Scale:** Utilizes a sequential "Inferno" interpolator to show standardized scores.
  - **Custom Legend:** Integrated indicator value scale at the base.

### 4. Scatter Linear Chart

- **Description:** Visualizes the correlation between wealth (GDP) and average life expectancy.
- **Features:**
  - **Regression Analysis:** Includes a fitted linear regression line to predict trends.
  - **Data Points:** Individual dots representing specific country coordinates.

### 5. Area Chart Trend Line

- **Description:** Tracks health expenditure trends over time (2000–2014) for the top 5 spending nations.
- **Features:**
  - **Stacked Areas:** Represents cumulative expenditure across the USA, Micronesia, Sierra Leone, Sweden, and Norway.
  - **Time Scaling:** Uses D3 time scales for accurate year-over-year progression.

## 🛠 Technical Configuration

- **Framework:** Angular 17+ with Standalone Component architecture.
- **Routing:** Centralized routing for seamless navigation between the Home view and Chart views.
- **Rendering:** Supports Client-Side Hydration and Animations for a smooth UI.
- **Data Sources:** All charts are populated via CSV files located in the `src/assets/` directory.

> **Note:** This project was developed as a Final Data Visualization (DV) Project focusing on Life Expectancy metrics.
